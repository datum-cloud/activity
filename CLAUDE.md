# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> **Context Optimization**: This file is structured for efficient agent usage. The "Agent Routing" section defines what context each agent needs. When spawning subagents, pass only relevant sections—not the entire file. Sections marked `<!-- reference -->` are lookup tables; don't include them in agent prompts unless specifically needed.

## Project Overview

Activity is a Kubernetes extension that provides queryable audit logs, events, and human-readable activity summaries. It's built as an aggregated API server, making it work natively with kubectl and Kubernetes clients.

**Module**: `go.miloapis.com/activity`

## Agent Routing

When working on this codebase, automatically use specialized agents based on the task type. Do NOT ask the user which agent to use - pick the appropriate one based on what files or features are being modified.

| Task Type | Agent | When to Use |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| UI/Frontend | `datum-platform:frontend-dev` | React, TypeScript, CSS, anything in `ui/` directory |
| Go Backend | `datum-platform:api-dev` | Go code in `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/` directories |
| Infrastructure | `datum-platform:sre` | Kustomize, Dockerfile, CI/CD, `config/` directory, `.infra/` for deployment |
| Tests | `datum-platform:test-engineer` | Writing or fixing Go tests |
| Code Review | `datum-platform:code-reviewer` | After implementation, before committing |
| Documentation | `datum-platform:tech-writer` | README, docs/, guides, API documentation |
| Architecture | `Plan` | Designing new features or significant refactors |
| Exploration | `Explore` | Understanding codebase structure or finding code |

**Key principles:**
- Use agents proactively without being asked
- For multi-step tasks, use the appropriate agent for each step
- After making code changes, consider using `code-reviewer` to validate
- For UI changes, run `npm run build` and `npm run test:e2e` to verify
- **Always test infrastructure changes in a test environment before opening a PR** - Deploy to the test-infra KIND cluster (`task test-infra:cluster-up`) and verify resources work correctly before pushing changes to staging/production repos
- **Use Telepresence for debugging staging issues** - When investigating bugs that only reproduce in staging, intercept the service and run it locally with `task test-infra:telepresence:intercept SERVICE=<name>`. See "Remote Debugging with Telepresence" section.

### Agent Context Requirements

Each agent only needs specific context. When spawning agents, pass minimal relevant info in prompts—don't repeat the entire CLAUDE.md:

| Agent | Required Context | Skip (don't include in prompt) |
|-------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| `frontend-dev` | UI commands, file paths in `ui/` | Go architecture, ClickHouse, NATS, data pipeline |
| `api-dev` | Go patterns, API resource types, key directories | UI commands, dev environment setup, migrations |
| `sre` | Config structure, build commands, deployment | Code architecture details, CEL patterns |
| `test-engineer` | Test commands, package being tested | Full architecture, deployment, UI |
| `Explore` | Key directories, architecture overview | Build commands, dev setup, deployment |
| `code-reviewer` | Architecture, multi-tenancy model, conventions | Dev environment, build commands |
| `tech-writer` | API resources, architecture overview | Implementation details, build commands |

### Agent Output Guidelines

Agents should return **concise summaries** to minimize context bloat in the parent conversation:

| Agent | Return | Don't Return |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| `Explore` | File paths + 1-line descriptions | Full file contents, extensive code quotes |
| `api-dev` | What was changed + file paths | Full diffs, unchanged code |
| `frontend-dev` | Components modified + any build errors | Full file contents |
| `code-reviewer` | Numbered findings list with file:line refs | Full code blocks for context |
| `test-engineer` | Pass/fail summary + failure messages only | Full test output, passing test details |
| `sre` | Changed manifests + deployment notes | Full YAML contents |

### Multi-Step Task Decomposition

For complex tasks, decompose to minimize per-agent context:

1. **Explore first** (use `model: "haiku"`): Find relevant files → return only paths
2. **Plan if needed**: Design approach → return bullet points only
3. **Implement** (sonnet): Work on specific files identified in step 1
4. **Review**: Check only the changed files

**Critical**: Pass only what's needed between steps. Don't re-explore what's already known.

## Build and Development Commands <!-- reference -->

All development tasks use [Task](https://taskfile.dev). Run `task --list` to see all available commands.

### Building

```bash
task build                    # Build the activity binary to bin/activity
task dev:build                # Build container image (ghcr.io/datum-cloud/activity:dev)
```

### Testing

```bash
go test ./...                 # Run all Go tests
go test ./internal/cel/...    # Run tests in a specific package
go test -run TestName ./...   # Run a specific test
```

### Code Generation

```bash
task generate                 # Run all code generation (OpenAPI, RBAC, migrations, docs)
task generate:openapi         # Generate Kubernetes OpenAPI definitions
task generate:rbac            # Generate RBAC manifests from kubebuilder annotations
task generate:docs            # Generate API reference documentation
```

### UI Component Library

The UI is a React component library in `/ui`:

```bash
cd ui && npm install && npm run build    # Build the library
cd ui && npm run lint                    # Lint TypeScript
cd ui && npm run type-check              # Type check
```

Or via Task:
```bash
task ui:build                            # Build component library
task ui:example:dev                      # Run example app in dev mode
```

## Architecture

### Components

- **activity-apiserver**: Kubernetes aggregated API server that handles queries and Watch streams
- **activity-processor**: Processes audit logs/events through ActivityPolicy rules to generate Activities
- **activity-controller-manager**: Manages ActivityPolicy lifecycle and status
- **kubectl-activity**: CLI plugin for command-line querying
- **activity-ui**: React component library for web interfaces

### Data Pipeline

1. **Audit logs/Events** → Published to NATS JetStream by control plane
2. **Vector** → Receives from NATS, routes to ClickHouse and back to NATS for processing
3. **activity-processor** → Consumes audit events, applies ActivityPolicy rules, produces Activities
4. **ClickHouse** → Stores audit logs, events, and activities for long-term querying
5. **etcd** → Stores ActivityPolicy resources with Watch support

### API Resources (`activity.miloapis.com/v1alpha1`) <!-- reference -->

| Resource | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| AuditLogQuery | Ephemeral | Execute audit log searches |
| AuditLogFacetsQuery | Ephemeral | Get distinct values for autocomplete |
| Activity | Read-only | Query translated activity records |
| ActivityFacetQuery | Ephemeral | Get distinct activity field values |
| ActivityPolicy | Persistent | Define translation rules (CEL-based) |
| PolicyPreview | Ephemeral | Test policies against sample inputs |
| EventQuery | Ephemeral | Query cluster events |
| EventFacetQuery | Ephemeral | Get distinct event field values |

### Key Directories

- `cmd/activity/` - Main binary entrypoint (subcommands: apiserver, processor, controller-manager)
- `internal/apiserver/` - Aggregated API server implementation
- `internal/storage/` - ClickHouse storage backend
- `internal/cel/` - CEL expression engine for ActivityPolicy rules
- `internal/processor/` - Activity translation processor
- `internal/controller/` - Kubernetes controller for ActivityPolicy
- `internal/watch/` - Watch API implementation via NATS consumers
- `pkg/apis/activity/v1alpha1/` - API type definitions
- `pkg/mcp/` - MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation
- `config/` - Kustomize deployment manifests
- `migrations/` - ClickHouse schema migrations
- `.infra/` - Cloned infra repo for deployment configuration (see Infrastructure Management below)

### Infrastructure Management

The `.infra/` directory contains a clone of the `datum-cloud/infra` repository. **Always use this folder for managing Activity's deployment infrastructure**, including:

- Flux Kustomizations
- Environment-specific patches (staging/production)
- Secret configurations
- Dependencies and deployment ordering

**Key paths in `.infra/`:**

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.infra/apps/activity-system/base/` | Base Flux Kustomizations for all Activity components |
| `.infra/apps/activity-system/overlays/staging/` | Staging-specific patches and resources |
| `.infra/apps/activity-system/overlays/production/` | Production-specific patches |
| `.infra/clusters/staging/apps/activity-system.yaml` | Staging cluster entry point |
| `.infra/clusters/production/apps/activity-system.yaml` | Production cluster entry point |

**Workflow for infrastructure changes:**

1. Make changes in `.infra/apps/activity-system/`
2. Commit and push to `datum-cloud/infra` repo (not this repo)
3. FluxCD will reconcile changes to the cluster

**Important:** The `.infra/` folder is gitignored from this repo. Changes must be committed to the infra repo separately.

## Development Environment <!-- reference -->

### Lightweight Dev Setup (single-replica, minimal resources)

```bash
task dev:setup               # Full setup: cluster + dependencies + deploy
task dev:redeploy            # Quick rebuild and redeploy after code changes
```

### Full Test Environment (HA with S3 storage)

```bash
task test:setup              # Full HA setup with 3-replica ClickHouse
task test:redeploy           # Quick rebuild and redeploy
```

### Cluster Access

```bash
task test-infra:kubectl -- <args>        # Run kubectl against dev cluster
task test-infra:kubectl -- get pods -n activity-system
task test-infra:kubectl -- logs -l app=activity-apiserver -n activity-system -f
```

### Database Migrations

```bash
task migrations:new NAME=description     # Create new migration file
task migrations:generate                 # Generate ConfigMap from migrations
task migrations:cluster:verify           # Verify schema in cluster
```

### Remote Debugging with Telepresence

When debugging issues in staging, use Telepresence to intercept a service and run it locally with full access to cluster resources (NATS, ClickHouse, etcd, milo).

```bash
# Install Telepresence CLI (one-time)
task test-infra:telepresence:install

# Connect to staging cluster
KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/gke-staging task test-infra:telepresence:connect

# Intercept a service to run locally
task test-infra:telepresence:intercept SERVICE=activity-apiserver NAMESPACE=activity-system PORT=6443

# Load environment variables from intercepted service
source /tmp/telepresence-activity-apiserver.env

# Run the service locally with debugger
go run ./cmd/activity apiserver --secure-port=6443

# When done, release the intercept
telepresence leave activity-apiserver
telepresence quit
```

**Available services to intercept:**
- `activity-apiserver` (port 6443) - API server handling queries
- `activity-processor` (port 8080) - Event processing pipeline
- `activity-controller-manager` (port 8080) - ActivityPolicy controller

**When to use Telepresence:**
- Debugging issues that only reproduce in staging with real data
- Testing changes against production-like NATS streams and ClickHouse data
- Investigating connectivity or configuration issues

## Multi-Tenancy Model

Data is scoped by tenant:
- **Platform**: All data across all tenants
- **Organization**: Data within a specific organization
- **Project**: Data within a specific project
- **User**: Actions performed by a specific user

Scopes are NOT hierarchically inclusive - query each scope directly.

## ActivityPolicy Translation

ActivityPolicy resources define how audit logs/events are translated into human-readable Activities using CEL expressions:

```yaml
apiVersion: activity.miloapis.com/v1alpha1
kind: ActivityPolicy
spec:
  resource:
    apiGroup: networking.datumapis.com
    kind: HTTPProxy
  auditRules:
    - match: "audit.verb == 'create'"
      summary: "{{ actor }} created {{ link(kind + ' ' + audit.objectRef.name, audit.responseObject) }}"
```

## Stable Codebase Facts <!-- reference -->

These locations rarely change—agents should use these directly without re-exploring:

| What | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| API type definitions | `pkg/apis/activity/v1alpha1/` | All CRD types live here |
| Storage implementations | `internal/storage/` | ClickHouse queries |
| CEL expression logic | `internal/cel/` | Policy matching engine |
| UI components | `ui/src/components/` | React component library |
| API server handlers | `internal/apiserver/` | REST handlers for each resource |
| Kustomize base | `config/base/` | Core deployment manifests |
| Kustomize components | `config/components/` | Optional features (ui, vector, etc.) |
| Database migrations | `migrations/` | ClickHouse schema files |
