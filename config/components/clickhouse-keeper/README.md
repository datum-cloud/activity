# ClickHouse Keeper Component

This component deploys a 3-node ClickHouse Keeper cluster to provide
coordination and metadata management for ClickHouse replication. ClickHouse
Keeper is the modern replacement for ZooKeeper.

Our configuration provides high availability (survives 1 node failure) with pod
anti-affinity ensuring nodes are distributed across the cluster.

## Usage

Include in your overlay:

```yaml
# config/overlays/{env}/kustomization.yaml
components:
  - ../../components/clickhouse-keeper
  - ../../components/clickhouse-database
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Deploy Keeper before ClickHouse or update ClickHouse after Keeper is ready.
