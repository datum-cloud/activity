  # Max ack pending: allow 5000 unacknowledged messages
  # Vector pulls in batches of 1000, so this allows multiple batches in-flight
  # Events are smaller than audit logs, so we can use a smaller buffer
  maxAckPending: 5000

  # Ack wait: 60 seconds before redelivery
  # Vector v0.50.0+ properly acknowledges messages after successful processing
  # This timeout handles cases where Vector crashes during processing
  ackWait: 60s

  # PULL-based consumer (no deliverSubject)
  # Vector will pull messages directly using JetStream pull consumer protocol
  # Messages are acknowledged only after successful delivery to ClickHouse
